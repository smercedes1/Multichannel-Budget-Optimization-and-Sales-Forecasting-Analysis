Hello everyone, during my senior year at Rutgers Business School, I was tasked with leading a project as part of my Statistics for Business course. 

Objective: To analyze and optimize marketing budget
allocations across multiple channels while accurately
forecasting sales trends.

Outcome: Developed data-driven models that identified
optimal budget allocations and improved ROI. Provided
actionable insights into channel performance, leading to
more effective resource distribution and accurate sales
predictions.
